## Description

A voxel game with simple and less proprietary software stack.

## Development roadmap
- [x] Freefly Camera
  - [x] Keyboard and mouse navigation
  - [x] Mouse Capture
- [x] Chunk rendering
  - [x] Write array chunk code
  - [x] Render a single block chunk
  - [x] Build a chunk using a start system
- [ ] Chunk interacton
  - [ ] Add voxel breaking
    - [ ] Use enum with id support for interaction
  - [ ] Add voxel placement
    - [ ] Add initial voxel selection
    - [ ] Figure out UI and display selected
- [ ] Player inventory
  - [ ] Initial belt
- [x] Load vox files
  - [ ] Figure out palette handling
  - [ ] Spawn at arbitrary location
- [ ] Rendering chunk multiple times in a grid
- [ ] Generating chunk data
  - [ ] Inserting chunk pos into chunk gen
  - [ ] Add state to chunk gen
  - [ ] Add object insertions to fix trees
  - [ ] Make all generation insertions
    - [ ] Add a way to group gen features (e.g. "nature_gen")
  - [ ] Add regions
    - [ ] Add structures
- [ ] Character
  - [ ] Belt - for being able to switch between multiple items
  - [ ] Material Cube - compressed storage container for a single material
  - [ ] Matter Cube - compressed storage container for all materials
  - [ ] Backpack - for carrying items around
    - finite capacity
    - can store material and matter cubes
- [ ] Tools
  - [ ] Pickaxe - appropriate tool for early survival
  - [ ] Material Manipulator - tool for manipulating materials
    - [ ] Material placement
      - modes:
        - [ ] AABB block
        - [ ] slope
        - [ ] stairs
    - [ ] Mining Extension
      - slot extension
  - [ ] Building Planner - tool for planning large construction
    - [ ] can leave a schematic behind to be constructed by Material Manipulator 
    - late game
